I wish to point out that Wdowiak, in turn, because there was a German colony where Germans lived, spoke highly of that Kultz[?] and told me to go to that German and work for him. I was apprehensive at first and Wdowiak told me, 'Don't be afraid, I guarantee that German would not do you any harm'. So I worked for three months for that German. His name was Ferdynand Kultz [?]. I have nothing but great respect for him. He lived through the war and was asking around to find out whether I made it. He treated me very well. He gave me food, he gave me food. I sewed for him and his wife. I sewed whatever I could. After that period, he just told me 'I cannot keep you any longer' and he sent me back to Wdowiak.
