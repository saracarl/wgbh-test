          "text": "She told me she would go first and I should be very careful so that nobody saw me and come to her place in the evening. The house was very poor and there were a lot of children. I told her I was Jewish and explained that I had a Kennkarte so she did not risk anything. She was very glad. Her name was Pokorska. There was a sewing machine in the house so I told her not to tell anybody that I was Jewish but to go to people she could trust and tell them that she was sheltering an escapee from Warsaw who had been in the underground and who could sew (and in this way we would be able to survive). She was very glad and she did this.\n\nOne day, either by accident or because someone had denounced me, I do not know, two German soldiers came into her apartment. I could not escape. They started talking to me. They were from Silesia so they spoke Polish too. I told them I was Mrs. Pokorska's son  and showed them a photograph and told them I was to go to Garwolin to obtain documents. Mrs. Pokorska confirmed that. They asked several times what my name was and  what I was doing there. I could understand what they spoke in German but  I pretended that I am a farmer and a little dumb. Finally they went away. All the time I had kept my composure and only later the fear began. I suspected that there might have been denunciation. People thought that I did not look Jewish and attended church but nobody visited me and they were also puzzled why there was such a  good-looking man in such a poor house. The  conclusion, at least for some of them, must have been that I was a Jew who were hiding. Others contradicted them that a Jew would not go to church, so the opinions were divided. \n"

          "text": "A month later, one night there came people who, I think, were from NSZ or WIN [NSZ- Narodowe Sily Zbrojne, a rightist Polish organization]. They asked for me and Mrs. Pokorska told them I was not there. They forbade her to tell me about their visit and they told her they would return. They wanted to kill me: I learnt about it from friends I had made in the village, people who did not care who I really was. It was close to the liberation, in April or May. The people who were looking for me came several times. Although they threatened Mrs. Pokorska with death she hid me in the bed (the one without a mattress), covered me with the straw and put her children on me. I would like everybody to know that those little children did not betray me, they lay still all the time when the men were in the house. I left the house immediately and lived hiding in the fields till the Red Army entered the village. Pokorska brought me food. \n\nThe Red Army entered Podwierzbie at the end of July or August 1. They saw me, I was not able to say a word in any language but finally an officer who was a Jew  talked to me and I told him I was Jewish and he told me they would take me to their commandant, major Buvnov the next day. They did come the next day and I stayed in his army as a tailor. I wore the army uniform but I did not carry a gun. I stayed with them till January in Podwierzbie and Podlez till they went away to fight. I stayed in Podwierzbie because Gora Kalwaria had not been liberated yet. Young people in  Podwierzbie simply loved me, I want to stress that word. They really liked me, young girls especially. I stayed with them till I learnt that Jews had returned to Gora Kalwaria in July. \n"

          "text": "I know that NSZ killed Jews even after the liberation and I want them to know about it but I love Poland and therefore I have not emigrated later. On the basis of my testimony Mrs. Pokorska and her family have been awarded the medal from Yad Vashem. I have been in touch with her and her brother all the time. Later I took them to Gora Kalwaria and  they have lived there now. I respect them very much and they like me very much, the children call me \"uncle\".\n\nWe knew  about the Warsaw Uprising, we even saw the flames. I often talked about it with the Russian soldiers but they said they would not help.\n\nI did not have any contacts with my family. It was still very dangerous for Jews and not only Jews were killed then. Bartoszewski describes that in his book \"Ten z ojczyzny mojej\"\n[\"The One from My Fatherland\"] : whole families who hid Jews were killed for that. There were a lot of good people  who helped Jews. For instance when I went to Sokolka to buy some leather  for shoes I saw a Jewish family who had lived with a Pole and the Jew was in his traditional, orthodox clothes and he had a beard. Hiding him was much more difficult then hiding a Jew like me wearing European clothes and speaking good Polish. The Pole cooked for them and he cooked dairy products and meat separately. He did not do that for money. He said he did it because he was religious. Not only did I see those Jews but I talked to them too. I regret that I do not know the name  of  that Pole and it is possible that he has already died because he was quite old at that time, but I am sure he must  have been in the history of  Sokolka. It was a couple with one child, the other two children they had  lost, I do not know how. It was a great risk to hide them dressed in traditional clothes and this Pole was not afraid of doing it. He told me he did it for the sake of his religion. Sokolka is in Bialystok region. \n\nI saw brother in 1943 when I stayed at Cwyl's. My brother escaped  from the Warsaw Ghetto and was hiding in the villages close to Magnuszewo working as a saddler for various families. One month or two before his death we said goodbye to each other because it was winter and I could not provide a shelter for him. Later I learnt from a neighbor that a German ?Jerke had taken him to a Jewish cemetery in Gora Kalwaria and shot him. Later I made a ?symbolic tomb there for my mother, brother and sister. \n"

I got some army clothes which I changed to fit me.\n\nWhen the war ended I also had a feeling that I was nearly the  only Jew who had survived such a terrible holocaust. The people who has not experienced holocaust cannot even imagine it and  it is pure fantasizing saying that this or that should have been done. Although the camps were placed in Poland it was not Poles' fault. There were nationalists among Poles but there were nationalists, even chauvinists among Jews too. Let's tell the truth. Maybe not to such an extent as to attack other nations because a Jew will never do that. I often ask Jews if they would be willing to risk and take Poles home if they knew that they might be killed for that. Because we had to understand that Poles were punished by death, I stress death, for helping Jews. If they had not been threatened with death, it would be a different story. Poles lived very well with Jews before the W.W.II, they traded with each other, did business. Mrs. Pokorska had six  small children and yet she took the risk. I had an ID stating I was a Pole but someone still could say she knew I was Jewish.  After the W.W.II I asked her to let me call her mother because she is a second mother for me. \n\nI would like all Jews who would see this film to understand it and not to blame Poles. Of course I know about other facts too. I know there were \"szmalcownicy\" [Jew-hunters]. I also know that some Poles from Ryczywol (close to Magnuszewo) murdered two Jews. I myself did not have any contacts with Jew-hunters. I know that there were Poles who took money for hiding Jews and then betrayed them. There was a case when Poles kept Jews even after the liberation for two or three months because they wanted to get more money but these were really single cases. I am proud that I can say truth.\n\nI would also like to say that Teykowski [a Polish nationalist, recently politically active, with a small group of followers, of little national importance] is not right. Being anti-Semitic, he and his punks are against themselves. I have respect even for this German [the one he sewed for] because he was a good man. He is probably dead now. I will always remember him. If I saw him after the war I would gave him bread or a place to sleep because he was a good man. He was simply born a German. Was my mother lower than others? I was born Jewish and I would always preserve my nationality. \n"

Some of them were unfortunately anti-Jewish like \"Szczerbiec\" [\"The Jagged Sword\"] and I saw it and thought how they could write such things after such terrible holocaust. We did not know all the names (those we learnt after the war) but we knew that there were extermination camps. Once when Hungarian Jews escaped from a train car near Garwolin and they were caught by Germans and Poles I heard a conversation among two Poles that they pitied those Jews very much. They did not know I could hear them. There were a lot of good Poles too. Some Poles were very poor, especially farmers and they preferred to go to Jews, for instance a Jewish tailor, because he would respect and serve them as he should and if they went to Polish craftsmen it was not the  case.\n\nWhen Russians who had liberated Podwierzbie went further on I did not go with them. I stayed in the village for a year and went to Gora Kalwaria in 1945 when I learnt that there were still Jews there. \n"
