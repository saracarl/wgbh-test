          "text": "I returned to Gora Kalwaria in 1945. About 15 Jews had returned from Russia, later they emigrated to Israel or America. My uncle from Gora Kalwaria survived the war in Zawichost. I do not  know where my mother died, I suppose that in the Warsaw Ghetto and I know nothing about my sister's fate. I wrote to various institutions in Poland and Israel but they did not have any information about them.\n\nWhen I returned to Gora Kalwaria I spent my first night at my neighbor's. My house had been pulled down so I rented a room. there was another tailor, he had survived Oswiecim, and we had a workshop together for some time. There were about 20 Jews in Gora Kalwaria if we add those who were survivors of Oswiecim or those who had been hidden. Only four have stayed till now: Feliks Kartman, Henryk MaJewski Wladyslaw Helman and I.\n\nI got married in Gora Kalwaria with my pre-war neighbor's daughter. We were married for 41. Our daughter lives in Piaseczno. I have three wonderful grandchildren: Mateusz, Ola and Jula. Ola recently has  been to Israel and liked it very much and this year younger Jula will go there. They belong to Szalom, they go on trips to Srodborow. They love their grandfather and I love them too. My wife died and I mourn her very much. Now there is another woman in my life, sort of second wife. She is Jewish. Her name is Slowik. She was born in Russia and she used to live in Zagan. We met in Warsaw. She is a widow. Her son is in America, a Chasid belonging to ?Bobov group. She is not orthodox. We live together and love each other.\n\nA lot of youth comes to Gora Kalwaria, especially Chasidim from Israel, France or America. They are interested in zaddik's house, the synagogue and cemetery. I often talk to these groups. Sometimes I joke with them because I know some Hebrew \n"

          "text": "They are very happy because it is very difficult to find a Jew in Warsaw district. Even if there are  some they do not admit they are Jewish. Gora Kalwaria is an exception, here people know we are Jewish and they like and respect us very much. MaJewski is a farmer, he has a lot of land and is one of the best fruit growers. When I stopped being a tailor I was a fruit grower too. \n\nMrs. Pokorska got her medal in the 60s. I am very glad of that because no Jewish mother could do more for me than she did. I want to emphasize it very strongly. Maybe I am not the  only one who says it but I want to say it.\n\nI have a cousin in Cholon \n\nin Israel. They survived the war in Russian. I have also cousins in ?Nebrak. They survived Oswiecim and they are Chasidim, followers of the zaddik of Gora Kalwaria. I saw them in Israel. Everybody in Israel liked me.\n\nPeople like me in general. Maybe because I am an optimist and I am objective, not prejudiced. I also know that maybe some people did not behave correctly towards me during the war but I pardon them. It was such a period, maybe they did not know what they were doing.\n\nAs regards 1968 in Poland I felt awful that it could take place after such a terrible holocaust during the W.W.II. Jews were to hide only because they were Jewish. What kind of communism was it? Shame on you who ruled Poland in 1968! Moczar does not live any more but if anyone from his group lives, shame on you for the sufferings of Jews. If it was not for Cardinal Wyszynski who told  people not to let communists fool the nation there could have been a pogrom [mass killings of Jews]. But Wyszynski said that it was not Jews who were guilty and thanks him for that.\n\nI do not have much to add. I want to greet all inhabitants of Gora Kalwaria  and tell them I know they respect me and I am very happy because of that. It is very important to have good relations with all people and with nature. I pitied Wysocki from Gora Kalwaria who was a decent man during the W.W.II but he was a loner and he died lonely too.\n\nThe Protestant cemetery in Gora Kalwaria is in a very bad condition. So is the Jewish cemetery. Shame on those Poles who removed the walls surrounding it and built houses out of it. It is a holy place. In 1945, when someone had just been buried sometimes the burial clothes would be taken. It is a dishonor for Catholic faith. \n"
