          "text": "Subject: Yes. she asked me. I mean I asked her, I begged her. And she said to me, 'Listen, I will go first. Just make sure that nobody sees you. You will come', she says, 'to my place in the evening and we will help you somehow'. So when I got to her place in the evening, there were many children. A poor household, a very poor household. But she took pity on me as we talked. I told her about it, I didn't hide my..., well, the fact that I was a Jew. I told her, 'Don't be afraid because I have a Kennkarte issued for such and such surname so not my real surname. You are not taking any risk here. You are just giving me refuge'. She was very pleased. Although they were poor, they happened to have a sewing machine at home. So I told her, 'Mrs Pokorska, that's very well. I'm a tailor by profession. When you walk home through the village and visit good friends that you have nothing to fear from, don't tell them that I'm a Jew. Tell them that a Pole from Warsaw is staying with you who is in hiding because he is a member of the resistance movement. Tell them that he can sew clothes and they can bring him clothes to sew. And we will make ends meet somehow'. She was very happy and she did as I told her to do. One day, the Germans came to the flat whether acting on a tip or by sheer chance. There was no way out. I couldn't escape. It was so unexpected. When the Germans came in, I cannot say at present whether it was divine power or it just happened like that but I wasn't afraid. I had no fear in me. I was bold with them. And I talked to them. They came in and looked at me. 'Who are you? I said, I'm that lady's son. 'Really?' 'Yes, I am'. I took my photo and put it on the table. I said, 'Look, I was supposed to go to Garwolin to have an ID card issued but I have no money at the moment and that's it'. He stared at me and saw that my face did not fit in with that place because, after all, it was a... So he turned to Mrs Pokorska and asked, 'Is this your son?'. And she replied, 'Yes, it is. And children, there are so many children at home'. Somehow I kept my cool. In general, I just wasn't afraid. I was absolutely in no fear at all. But the German didn't seem to believe us. He asked once again what I was doing there. I said 'yes' because he noticed that I had been sewing something for somebody. A coat on a hanger. And that German says in German to the other, 'How come such coat is in this flat?' [Kuk was so ein schoen Mantel ist in so ein Haus]."

Those thoughts rash through your head. It's unbelievable. But he didn't pay attention to what I was saying but instead addressed that woman. And he asked the question in Polish because he was from Silesia. 'Is this your son?'. She replied, 'Yes, it is'. So he asked me what I did for a living. In Polish, too. So I told him, 'In summer, [he imitates the sounds made by drivers of horse-drawn carts] and in winter [he pretends to be flailing]'."

At the time, we were moonshining like every poor household during the Nazi occupation. From beetroot. They came close to me and one said to the other 'kuck, kuck' [Look, look]. And I said, 'Moonshine, beetroot, red beet juice, red beet juice, red beet juice'. 'Ah, verdummter Mann' Then, they left the flat and as they were leaving I realized I could be denounced as a Jew here because people said different thingsin the village, he didn't quite look like a Jew, he does go to church but nobody visits him and he doesn't really fit with the Pokorskis, their poor house. So maybe he is a Jew in hiding. And others would say 'how could he be a Jew if he goes to church?'. And that was the version [of the story] that the people in the village believed. But whether or not I might get denounced, I said to myself if they had showed interest in me, then I could no longer live in the flat. If they were to come in again, I'd better be out... I went outside and started stacking the firewood I chopped [inaudible] for winter. While doing so I watched them.  At that point, one of them came back and asked [Mrs. Pokorska] once again, 'Is this really your son?' And she replied, 'Yes, he's my son'. Then I told her, 'If he comes back again, I'll try to run away, let him kill me then instead of…."

They said, 'Heniek, be careful because they want to liquidate you'. During that period, two men came with a gun. Me and Mrs. Pokorska, we thought hard. There was a high bed. With a wooden board on the side. The bed had no straw mattress just straw. And she told me, 'You know what, Heniek, get into the bed and cover yourself with straw and I'll put the children on top of you'. And that's what we did. They came in and started asking questions and I could hear everything that was being said. They asked about this and that. They told Mrs. Pokorska, 'Listen, you're not to tell him anything. We'll be back. He'd better be there'. She didn't say a word. 'You're lying to us, bring a shovel because you'll be digging up your own grave'. They said that to Mrs. Pokorska. She took the shovel and went out with them [inaudible]. When they saw her grab the shovel, they might actually have thought that I wasn't there. This is typical. Let the whole world know that three or four small children were there. They didn't betray me, they didn't shout, 'He's here!' and they were not afraid. As soon as they had left, I went into hiding. I no longer hid in that flat. I wandered through fields and bushes, here and there. Mrs. Pokorska only brought me food. And so I was hiding for a few months wherever I could until the arrival of the Red Army. The Red Army entered the village of Podwierzbie  either in late July, on July 29th or 30th or on August 1st. At the time, I was lying on a levee nearby. I saw their reconnaissance unit, the so-called razvedka. They were armed and they looked at me. I wasn't unshaven because Mrs. Pokorska bought razor blades for me whenever she could. I shaved."

In the end, I said, 'I hid here, hid, here, I hid here'. And there happened to be a lieutenant who understood something. He was a Jew. He had an idea and he asked me, 'Who are you? Who are you?' And I said to him, 'I'm Yevrey'. The lieutenant stopped right away and told his soldiers to put down their weapons, not to keep them pointed at me. He said that they would come the following day and take me to their military commander. Bubnov [?], Major Bubnov [?], their military commander was nearby.  And, true to their word, they came the following day and took me to Bubnov. Bubnov enlisted me in the Red Army as a volnonayomniy, a non-military volunteer.  I sewed for them over a longer period of time. It was, let's say, in August, September and the offensive started in January. They kept me by their side until January, I wore an army uniform but carried no weapon, nothing, and I just sewed uniforms and clothes and everything for them."

Any moment, every every every gesture could betray you. Every gesture could betray you as a Jew. After all, you were given a death penalty for hiding Jews. Not only one person but the whole family. There were towns and villages described, among other things, by Władysław Bartoszewski in his book titled 'The Samaritans, heroes of the Holocaust' [Ten z ojczyzny mojej], where entire families had been executed.  Those were very good people. Those were very good people. I wish to stress that once again. I'll say it again, I wish to stress that I went to Sokolka when the Soviet Army was there to buy leather for shoes and uppers. Some Jews were already there, too. There, I saw a family, a Jewish family, that had been kept hidden by a Pole. The Jew wore a chalat [Jewish frock] and was bearded, and that Pole would prepare milk and meat meals for him separately. He didn't do it for money. I don't believe that a man would ever do... something like that. He did it in the name of faith. That Pole did it in the name of humanism, in the name of faith. I talked to him. It's pity I don't know his name. He is certainly dead already because he was old at the time. I also spoke to that Jewish family. They were from Sokolka, from Sokolka, that village. I saw that Jew, that, that Jewish woman and one child with my own eyes. Two of their children died. I don't know in what circumstances. But what is characteristic is that the Pole provided shelter to Jews in that attire. It was different to hide me or another person dressed more or less like a European, a person who like me speaks good Polish. That probably involved less risk. But what what what he did was extremely risky. And still he was not afraid and claimed, 'I did it in the name of faith'. That's what that Pole said to me. Sokolka is a town somewhere in the Bialystok province, that's where the town is. It certainly is part of history, there's no doubt that it is."

The people who didn't live through the Holocaust cannot even conceive what it was like although sometimes this or that is being said, why this, why that.  Even though those camps were set up in Poland, the Poles are not to be blamed. Let those Jews once and for all... and I mean all Jews because there are also nationalists among Jews. There are even chauvinists. Let's tell each other the truth. Maybe not to the same extent as in other nations because a Jew would never assault anyone. This is another issue. But there are nationalists. They have their views. But it was not like that. Who would want to welcome the Jews if they knew, just like such Polish families did, that they risked their life? We, Jews who lived through the war, talk about it because we know it. We've seen it. I say so confidently as an elderly man because I know it. So they shouldn't be surprised that people hold grudges against this or that person. I don't want to dwell on it too long but I put the same question again to Jews, since I speak objectively, I ask all those who talk this way, would they be willing to take that risk? Would they take a Pole home knowing that … if this did not come with the death penalty?. Let me stress that word – death - because Jews coexisted very well with Poles and so did Poles with Jews before the war. They traded and had business dealings, and were happy with it. But when the death penalty comes into play - is there a higher price than death? Nevertheless, they did it, like Mrs. Pokorska who welcomed me, that mother with so many children. One, two, three, four, six children. They still chose to take that risk. I had my Kennkarte but eventually somebody could have claimed that she had known I was a Jew. If I [inaudible] am I not fond of that person till the present day? She's like a mother to me. Once it was over, I told her, 'Let me call you mother'. She's my second mother. Let Jews remember that. Those who understand this recording and who see this recording should acknowledge that fact. Let them hold no grudges. Yes, there were also shmaltsovniks [persons blackmailing the Jews who were hiding, or blackmailing Poles who protected the Jews during the Nazi occupation], there were such incidents for sure. The truth must be told because I speak objectively. I'm telling the truth. They did exist, some even hid Jews, I know one case from Ryczywol.  Two Jews were murdered there. By Poles from Ryczywol, none other."

The man replied that it was for Polish scouts only. And Bartoszewski describes the situation. Was he right Absolutely not. And that mother denounces that fact too and she tells the truth. I say the same thing. Was he right [to say so]? Absolutely not. And that Tejkowski?  Can I talk here about...? Take that Tejkowski who makes public appearances nowadays as a sworn anti-Semite. Is he right? In my view and in the opinion of good people, he is absolutely wrong. What is the point of being against anything? If he is against Jews or those skinheads, they are against each other. They hate themselves. They fight each other with knives, bats and such. So I'm asking him the question, here during this TV interview, 'Are you right?'  Absolutely not. Isn't it better to have a positive attitude towards other people, regardless of whether that person is a Gypsy, a Pole, a Russian or a German? I even have respect for that German. He may already be dead but I have respect for him and I'll always keep him in my thoughts. If I were to see him after the war, I would certainly give him not only bread but also my bed and everything. Because he was a Germ... because he was a human being. Is this relevant? Him being German isn't relevant. He was born that way. Was my mother inferior to somebody else's mother? This is how I was born, this is who I am and will be. I'll always keep my nationality.
