          "text": "I come from Gora Kalwaria, a small town south of Warsaw; 50% of inhabitants was Catholic and 50% was Jewish. But there was a  very famous zaddik from the Alter family and Jews from many places would come to gather for big holidays like for instance, Yom Kippur or Rosh Hoshanah. My name is Henryk ?Prais [Prajs]. I was born in Gora Kalwaria (WOWW 2,961 Jews, EJ +-3,500) on December 30 1916.\n\nI come from a poor family, my father was killed by bandits when I was two or three years old. There was my mother and three children. My mother was a dressmaker. She tried to provide us with at least minimum of education, i.e. elementary school. The teachers were very nice for us, Jewish children and in the pre-war period there was no anti-Semitism in Gora Kalwaria. The coexistence between the Polish and Jewish communities was very good.\n\nMy family was not chasydic, we were not religious. I attended Polish  school but I also learnt Yiddish in a Jewish (hedar) school. I also learnt some Hebrew. I completed six years of the elementary school and had to stop going to school because  of the  poor conditions at home and I started my three-year training to be a tailor. Then I worked for Gorecki who was a Catholic, then two more years for someone else, also as a tailor.\n"

          "text": "Gora Kalwaria had 7000 inhabitants, 3000 Jews and 4000 Poles {see above statistics}. Most Jews worked as craftsmen there were no factories. Most of them were modern, they did not wear traditional clothes but  European ones. There were not so many Hasidim, about 1000, including 500 of the followers of the zaddik {Abraham Mordecai Alter} from Gora Kalwaria but Jews from all over Poland used to come to him during holidays. He was a very wise man. Even Catholics respected him and came to get his advice. He did not walk in Gora Kalwaria but each Saturday he would appear on his balcony at 3 p.m. and he would walk for 15 minutes and his followers would gather in the courtyard and be very happy to see him. His house has survived the war. There were a few rooms, the synagogue was big. Now Jews from all over the world come for pilgrimages. The zaddik lived better than ordinary Jews who were happy when they had a room and a kitchen in Gora Kalwaria. I myself lived in one room and there was my mother's workshop in this room too.\n\nThe inhabitants of Gora Kalwaria were very glad that the zaddik was famous because a lot of people came to the  town and they rented rooms and each of them also paid one zloty to the town budget.  Mayor Dziejko was a decent man,  he gave an order when there were town elections that Jews should have their representatives in the Town Council.\n"

          "text": "Janica, a police commandant, was a very good man too. When Falanga groups [Polish nationalistic groups harassing Jews] were coming from other places in Poland he would urge Jews to be very careful and to fight back. Later he died in Katyn. Even today people remember him and regret his death very much. \n\nI want to emphasize that the relations between Poles and Jews were very good in Gora Kalwaria and there was no anti-Semitism.\n\nWe spoke Yiddish and polish at home, Yiddish was my first language. I had a lot of Poles as my friends, we played in the same courtyard. There were Bronek Wozniak, Joziek, Olek Rytko, Maniek Jarosz.  When I returned after the war I went to Mr. Franciszek Rytko, a shoe maker who kept in his apartment holy Jewish books and also my grandfather's photograph. He was not afraid to hide those things! In 1946 I gave the books to Jewish Religious Congregation in Warsaw.\n\nAt school there were fewer Jewish boys because only modern Jews would send their children to a Polish school. Teachers would come to Hasidic children but they would learn in Polish.\n\nMy sister completed 7 years of elementary school. She was very gifted. Then she went to Warsaw and worked as a bookkeeper in a small soap factory in 14 Radzyminska street. She was a very good student. I was good at Polish, history and German but I was a little worse at mathematics but I there had never been any problems. My brother, like me completed six years of the  elementary school and started training to be a saddler.\n"

          "text": "On November 4 1937 I was taken to the army. I was in Suwalki, in Third Light-Cavalry Regiment named after Jan Hippolit Kozietulski; it was a selected regiment, there were only three such regiments in Poland (in Warsaw and Stargard Gdanski). I was a good soldier so I was selected for an eight month course for noncommissioned officers and completed it becoming a corporal. Soon W.W.II began so I did not return home.  There were four squadrons in the regiment and there were four Jews in each of them. In mine there was also Jan Kenberg, Jakub Feldman and I do not remember the fourth. The relations with other colleagues were really very good and I want to emphasize it. They liked me very much, 100% till now. Among others, during the W.W.II I had a friend, Jozef Wolski and we asked each other to pass the news to the family in case one of us died.\n\nWhen I came back to Gora Kalwaria for a leave I was very respected and girls were interested in me. We had caps which were special, different from the rest of the army. I had also a sabre.\nThere was also a rabbi, a captain in the Bialystok garrison. He used to visit us and had talks with us. He told us that army and Poland was our first duty and then came the rest. We used to be taken to synagogue on Sunday, not Saturday. On Sunday the Catholics were lead to the  church, the Orthodox to the Orthodox church and Protestants to Protestant churches. \n\nGoing to pray was not obligatory. Similarly one did not have to join soldiers every morning and evening to take part in singing Catholic hymns. Life of a Jewish soldier was the same as the life of a Polish soldier, there was no difference and if he was competent he was distinguished. The military service lasted for two years. \n"

Beck said we would not give the enemy Gdansk nor would we give him a button, but during the war we saw that his speech was very unrealistic. Everybody wanted to defend our country. We also believed that England and France would help us after their declaration of war against Germany.\n\nWe had Germans in our regiment, I even remember their names: Bertold, Zoller, Bratz and Mann and I must say they stayed with us till the end and did not betray and did not desert the army while Ukrainians and Byelorussians deserted the army as soon as we reached Eastern areas.\n\nIn 1933 when Hitler got power no Jews realized what might happen although we knew about the persecutions in Germany and we knew about \"Mein Kampf\". Of course there was a strong emigration movement in the thirties and a lot of people talked about it. I myself belonged to [Hapoel?].\n\nand Po'alei Zion, rightist movement (I had been interested in that since I was 13, first as a scout) but emigration was not so easy because it was difficult to get a certificate. If it had been easy all but the old would have emigrated somewhere.\n\nThere were different Jewish parties in Gora Kalwaria: communistic, Bund( the smallest), Mizrachi, ?Hertzl's organization i.e. rightist Zionists and Po'alei Zion, rightist one, there was no leftist Po'alei Zion. I had been in Po'alei Zion till I went to the army. \n"
