          "text": "In July 1940 I did not have to move because my building was in the ghetto but there came others and we had to accept them. Some families from the neighboring villages came to Gora Kalwaria too. Dominikanska street, the market place, Strazacka street and part of Pijarska street and Kalwaryjska street were the ghetto borders. It was not closed completely, there was barbed wire on one side in Strazacka street (so that people could not cross the Wisla River) but there were streets which went through the ghetto and they were not closed but Jews were told they would be killed if they went outside the ghetto. There were no gates. I lived in Pilsudskiego street. Catholics lived in the same building:  Wozniak, Rytko and Jarosz and they had to leave their apartments and go to Jewish apartments while Jews came to live in their apartments. In my small apartment (5 metres by 6 metres [ 17 feet by 20 feet]) there were five people: my family and someone from the countryside sent by Judenrat.\n\nThere was typhus because there were sometimes 10 people in very small apartments, lack of food, the poor people ate soup and a piece of bread offered by Judenrat. Richer people had to give contributions because a bath was to be built for Jews. When the bath was ready Jews were deported to Warsaw. There were Jewish police but they did not beat people and  only came to apartments and took to work people selected by Judenrat.\n\nNext to our apartment there was a closet and this additional person sent by Judenrat slept there. We were not allowed to leave the ghetto, people were not allowed to visit us, we could do no work apart from the forced labor, we were hungry. A lot of people died, at that time Germans still allowed to go to the cemetery and bury the dead.\n\nWhen I came back to Gora Kalwaria a lot of Catholics friends visited me, Joziek Lewandowski used to give me firewood, a lot of them sympathized with me. Even in 1940  they brought wood or potatoes. My family and I were not hungry although it was not that we had plenty, but we had potatoes or groats [Polish \"kasza\"=kasha]. We even were able to sustain the man who lived with us thanks to my Catholic friends, Poles.\n\nIn July 1940 it was different. Poles were not allowed to enter the ghetto. Some Jews who went outside the ghetto and did not returned in the right moment were shot by Germans in the  streets. \n"

          "text": "Germans were afraid of typhus so they were not present in the ghetto. There were the navy-blue police. I had an uncle in Warsaw, I visited him on my way back from U.S.S.R before I went to Gora Kalwaria.  There were no ghetto in Warsaw yet. We knew about persecutions, roundups and killings. \n\nI did not have any immediate contacts with Germans yet. When I reported to work I was told to take off my cap but it was all. They  had never been in our apartment. Volksdeutche would rob richer Jews of money, cigarettes anything of value. They came with carts and took everything. We did not have anything (only a sewing machine).\n\nOn February 25 and 26 1941 Judenrat ordered all Jews to gather at 7 a.m. (with only a small hand luggage) in front of the Jewish town hall. People cried but the navy-blue police took them to the train and sent to Warsaw {Sept 1942, EG}. A few days before I had escaped to Magnuszewo. Jews were deported from there only in 1942. I walked from Gora Kalwaria to Magnuszewo and spent nights in Polish houses. I was given shelter because there was no death sentence for helping Jews yet. I had known about the Warsaw ghetto and did not want to go there. My mother, sister and brother went to the Warsaw ghetto. I was advised to escape because I did not look Jewish. I did not escape earlier because I did not want to leave my family (my brother was 3 years younger and my sister was 2 years older, she was born in 1914). They could not escape from the ghetto because they did not have any money. I survived because I was a tailor."

          "text": "Magnuszew is near Kozienice, 19 kilometres south from Gora Kalwaria. I rented an apartment from Wojtas, a blacksmith and I stayed there, as a Jew, for a year till the deportation. All that time I was as a Jew, why should I desert my roots? When the others still lived, I lived with them as they did, only later it changed.\n\nTill June or July 1942 people came to my apartment and I sewed clothes for them in Magnuszewo. There were arm-bands. In July Germans organized a ghetto (for two months) {EG, created 3/41- 9/32}. Jan Cwyl, my Polish very close friend advised me to obtain a Catholic birth certificate. I got it in Osiecko from the priest {cannot verify, 2 in BGN, quite far away}. My new name was Feliks Zoladek. I also got a mobilization card. On the basis of these two documents Roman Szczydlinski from Magnuszewo gave me my Kennkarte [a German document proving Polish identity]. From that moment I passed as a Pole. Jan Cwyl kept me for a month in his house, I was also at Wdowiak's (I sewed for them, they knew I was Jewish but I stayed there as a Pole). The priest knew I was Jewish, I told him. He gave me the Catholic birth certificate and he did not want any payment for it. He blessed me. Feliks Zoladek, a Pole, had belonged to this parish and died. The documents were very important also for people who gave me shelter because there had already a death sentence for anyone helping a Jew. Since I had a Kennkarte they could always say they did not know about anything because I had right documents. \n\nSoon the Jews from Magnuszewo were deported to Kozienice (EG). I had already had my Kennkarte but I did not show it to anyone and I went to a forced labor camp in Chmielewo along with other young Jews whom Germans deported there {cannot verify, several very close to Magnuszew}. They were to dig ditches for food. I did not believe that war would last so long and I thought I would survive there. I stayed there till December 1943. I worked there as a Jew. There were 100 Jews in the camp, we slept in the fire station. When Jews were deported from this camp to Kozienice I went to Magnuszewo and Jan Cwyl took me to his house. After a month he sent me to Wdowiak and I sewed clothes there too for a few months. There were a lot of Germans who had lived in Magnuszewo before the W.W.II. Later Wdowiak told me to go to a German to sew clothes. I was afraid to do that at the beginning but Wdowiak told me not to be afraid because Wdowiak guaranteed that the German would not do any harm to me. I stayed at Ferdinand Kurtz's for three months and sewed clothes. He gave me food and treated me very well. After the W.W.II he asked whether I had survived the war. Later he sent me back to Wdowiak."

          "text": "When I was in Chmielewo I did not have any contacts with my mother and my siblings. I knew that my mother had died in the  ghetto. I saw my brother and sister in Gowaczeow near Magnuszew in January 1943. They escaped from the Warsaw ghetto. My brother lived in various villages working as a saddler till he was betrayed to Germans. Germans shot him in spring 1944 on the cemetery in Gora Kalwaria. I made him a symbolic grave.\n\nI had sent my mother some groats to the ghetto but I did not have any letters from her.\n\nJews from Chmielewo were marched to Magnuszewo and later to Kozienice. I stayed in Magnuszewo. A lot of Jews stayed I had a friend, others tried to hide somewhere. I do not know were the  Jews from Kozienice were sent, probably to Majdanek or  Treblinka.\n\nI did not appear as Feliks Zoladek in Magnuszewo and all people who helped me knew I was Jewish. Only when I went  to the other side of the Wisla River I was Feliks Zoladek and there I was not hiding, I went  to church, etc. While I stayed at Kurtz's (he was a volksdeutch) he knew I was Jewish and one more German knew about it but I did not sew anything for that other German, only a pair of trousers for his son.  I felt secure in Ostrow near Magnuszew {cannot verify, 2 in BGN next to Magnuszew}. People knew me at the village but nobody betrayed me. They liked me. I am one  of the million who has survived. I was lucky; I was not especially hidden.\n\nLater people in Ostrow began to fear Germans because a lot of Poles were shot by Germans in 1943 and beginning of 1944 in Magnuszewo. Wdowiak told me that it would be better if I went to the other side of the Wisla River but as a Pole not as Henryk Preis but as Zoladek. \n"
